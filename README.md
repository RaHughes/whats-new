# What's New?

This application was built with `create-react-app`. 


# Learning Goals

- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
- Learn to pass information between components using props.
- Learn to write readable JSX (your render methods/return statements should be clean and simple).
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Learn how to unit test React components including snapshot testing, methods, and changes in state.


# My Experience

I feel this project gave me an opportunity to exerience React at a very basic level. I tried to write 
squaky clean code, but focus more on learning state manipulation, and component building through React.
I was able to get a handle on passing props and changing state, as well as writing JSX and building 
components. I was able to get a very basic handle on testing with Snapshot as well.
